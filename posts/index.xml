home is the mouth of a shark
you only run for the border
when you see the whole city running as well
your neighbors running faster than you
breath bloody in their throats
the boy you went to school with
who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory
is holding a gun bigger than his body
you only leave home</description></item><item><title>Breathe. As in. (shadow) by Rosamond S. King</title><link>https://matchalunatic.github.io/posts/breathe.as-in.shadow-by-rosamond-s-king/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matchalunatic.github.io/posts/breathe.as-in.shadow-by-rosamond-s-king/</guid><description>Breathe
. As in what if
the shadow is gold
en? Breathe. As in
hale assuming
exhale. Imagine
that. As in first
person singular. Homonym
:eye. As in subject. As
in centeroftheworld as in
mundane. The opposite of spectacle
spectacular. This is just us
breathing. Imagine
normalized respite
gold in shadows
. You have the
right to breathe and remain
. Imagine
that

for what I’ve made
of myself.
 Soil recoils
from my hooked kisses.
 Pines turn their backs
on me. They know
what I can do
with the wrap of my legs.
 Each summer,
when the air becomes crowded
with want, I set all my tongues
upon you.
 To quiet this body,
you must answer
my tendrilled craving.
 All I’ve ever wanted</description></item><item><title>Langston Blue, by Jericho Brown</title><link>https://matchalunatic.github.io/posts/langston-blue-by-jericho-brown/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matchalunatic.github.io/posts/langston-blue-by-jericho-brown/</guid><description>“O Blood of the River of songs,
O songs of the River of Blood,”
Let me lie down. Let my words
Lie sound in the mouths of men
Repeating invocations pure
And perfect as a moan
That mounts in the mouth of Bessie Smith.
Blues for the angels kicked out
Of heaven. Blues for the angels
Who miss them still. Blues
For my people and what water
They know. O weary drinkers</description></item><item><title>My Lover is a Woman, by Pat Parker</title><link>https://matchalunatic.github.io/posts/my-lover-is-a-woman-by-pat-parker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matchalunatic.github.io/posts/my-lover-is-a-woman-by-pat-parker/</guid><description>I.
my lover is a woman
&amp;amp; when i hold her
feel her warmth
i feel good
feel safe
then—i never think of
my family’s voices
never hear my sisters say
bulldaggers, queers, funny
come see us, but don’t
bring your friends
it’s ok with us,
but don’t tell mama
it’d break her heart
never feel my father
turn in his grave
never hear my mother cry
Lord, what kind of child is this?</description></item><item><title>The Talking Back of Miss Valentine Jones: Poem # one, by June Jordan</title><link>https://matchalunatic.github.io/posts/the-talking-back-of-miss-valentine-jones-poem-number-one-by-june-jordan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matchalunatic.github.io/posts/the-talking-back-of-miss-valentine-jones-poem-number-one-by-june-jordan/</guid><description>well I wanted to braid my hair
bathe and bedeck my
self so fine
so fully aforethought for
your pleasure
see:
I wanted to travel and read
and runaround fantastic
into war and peace:
I wanted to
surf
dive
fly
climb
conquer
and be conquered
THEN
I wanted to pickup the phone
and find you asking me
if I might possibly be alone
some night

The road ahead bends sideways and I lurch within myself.
I’m full of ugly feelings, awful thoughts, bad dreams
of doom, and so much love left unspoken.
Is mercury in retrograde? someone asks.
Someone answers, No, it’s something else
like that though. Something else like that.
That should be my name.
When you ask me am I really a woman, a human being,</description></item></channel></rss>
