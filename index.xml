&lt;p>no one leaves home unless&lt;br>
home is the mouth of a shark&lt;br>
you only run for the border&lt;br>
when you see the whole city running as well&lt;/p>
&lt;p>your neighbors running faster than you&lt;br>
breath bloody in their throats&lt;br>
the boy you went to school with&lt;br>
who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory&lt;br>
is holding a gun bigger than his body&lt;br>
you only leave home&lt;br>
when home won’t let you stay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>no one leaves home unless home chases you&lt;br>
fire under feet&lt;br>
hot blood in your belly&lt;br>
it’s not something you ever thought of doing&lt;br>
until the blade burnt threats into&lt;br>
your neck&lt;br>
and even then you carried the anthem under&lt;br>
your breath&lt;br>
only tearing up your passport in an airport toilet&lt;br>
sobbing as each mouthful of paper&lt;br>
made it clear that you wouldn’t be going back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>you have to understand,&lt;br>
that no one puts their children in a boat&lt;br>
unless the water is safer than the land&lt;br>
no one burns their palms&lt;br>
under trains&lt;br>
beneath carriages&lt;br>
no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck&lt;br>
feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled&lt;br>
means something more than journey.&lt;br>
no one crawls under fences&lt;br>
no one wants to be beaten&lt;br>
pitied&lt;/p>
&lt;p>no one chooses refugee camps&lt;br>
or strip searches where your&lt;br>
body is left aching&lt;br>
or prison,&lt;br>
because prison is safer&lt;br>
than a city of fire&lt;br>
and one prison guard&lt;br>
in the night&lt;br>
is better than a truckload&lt;br>
of men who look like your father&lt;br>
no one could take it&lt;br>
no one could stomach it&lt;br>
no one skin would be tough enough&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the&lt;br>
go home blacks&lt;br>
refugees&lt;br>
dirty immigrants&lt;br>
asylum seekers&lt;br>
sucking our country dry&lt;br>
niggers with their hands out&lt;br>
they smell strange&lt;br>
savage&lt;br>
messed up their country and now they want&lt;br>
to mess ours up&lt;br>
how do the words&lt;br>
the dirty looks&lt;br>
roll off your backs&lt;br>
maybe because the blow is softer&lt;br>
than a limb torn off&lt;/p>
&lt;p>or the words are more tender&lt;br>
than fourteen men between&lt;br>
your legs&lt;br>
or the insults are easier&lt;br>
to swallow&lt;br>
than rubble&lt;br>
than bone&lt;br>
than your child body&lt;br>
in pieces.&lt;br>
i want to go home,&lt;br>
but home is the mouth of a shark&lt;br>
home is the barrel of the gun&lt;br>
and no one would leave home&lt;br>
unless home chased you to the shore&lt;br>
unless home told you&lt;br>
to quicken your legs&lt;br>
leave your clothes behind&lt;br>
crawl through the desert&lt;br>
wade through the oceans&lt;br>
drown&lt;br>
save&lt;br>
be hunger&lt;br>
beg&lt;br>
forget pride&lt;br>
your survival is more important&lt;/p>
&lt;p>no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear&lt;br>
saying-&lt;br>
leave,&lt;br>
run away from me now&lt;br>
i dont know what i’ve become&lt;br>
but i know that anywhere&lt;br>
is safer than here&lt;/p>

O songs of the River of Blood,”&lt;br>
       Let me lie down. Let my words&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lie sound in the mouths of men&lt;br>
Repeating invocations pure&lt;br>
       And perfect as a moan&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That mounts in the mouth of Bessie Smith.&lt;br>
Blues for the angels kicked out&lt;br>
       Of heaven. Blues for the angels&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who miss them still. Blues&lt;br>
For my people and what water&lt;br>
       They know. O weary drinkers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drinking from the bloody river,&lt;br>
Why go to heaven with Harlem&lt;br>
       So close? Why sing of rivers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With fathers of our own to miss?&lt;br>
I remember mine and taste a stain&lt;br>
       Like blood coursing the body&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of a man chased by a mob. I write&lt;br>
His running, his sweat: here,&lt;br>
       He climbs a poplar for the sky,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it is only sky. The river?&lt;br>
Follow me. You’ll see. We tried&lt;br>
       To fly and learned we couldn’t&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Swim. Dear singing river full&lt;br>
Of my blood, are we as loud under&lt;br>
       Water? Is it blood that binds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brothers? Or is it the Mississippi&lt;br>
Running through the fattest vein&lt;br>
       Of America? When I say home,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean I wanted to write some&lt;br>
Lines. I wanted to hear the blues,&lt;br>
       But here I am swimming in the river&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again. What flows through the fat&lt;br>
Veins of a drowned body? What&lt;br>
       America can a body call&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Home? When I say Congo, I mean&lt;br>
Blood. When I say Nile, I mean blood.&lt;br>
       When I say Euphrates, I mean,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If only you knew what blood&lt;br>
We have in common. So much,&lt;br>
       In Louisiana, they call a man like me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Red. And red was too dark&lt;br>
For my daddy. And my daddy was&lt;br>
       Too dark for America. He ran&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like a man from my mother&lt;br>
And me. And my mother’s sobs&lt;br>
       Are the songs of Bessie Smith&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who wears more feathers than&lt;br>
Death. O the death my people refuse&lt;br>
       To die. When I was 18, I wrote down&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The river though I couldn’t win&lt;br>
A race, climbed a tree that winter, then&lt;br>
       Fell, flat on my wet, red face. Line&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After line, I read all the time,&lt;br>
But “there was nothing I could do&lt;br>
       About race.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>my lover is a woman&lt;br>
&amp;amp; when i hold her&lt;br>
feel her warmth&lt;br>
     i feel good&lt;br>
     feel safe&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then—i never think of&lt;br>
my family’s voices&lt;br>
never hear my sisters say&lt;br>
bulldaggers, queers, funny&lt;br>
     come see us, but don’t&lt;br>
     bring your friends&lt;br>
          it’s ok with us,&lt;br>
          but don’t tell mama&lt;br>
          it’d break her heart&lt;br>
never feel my father&lt;br>
turn in his grave&lt;br>
never hear my mother cry&lt;br>
Lord, what kind of child is this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>II.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>my lover’s hair is blonde&lt;br>
&amp;amp; when it rubs across my face&lt;br>
it feels soft&lt;br>
     feels like a thousand fingers&lt;br>
     touch my skin &amp;amp; hold me&lt;br>
          and i feel good&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then—i never think of the little boy&lt;br>
who spat &amp;amp; called me nigger&lt;br>
never think of the policemen&lt;br>
who kicked my body &amp;amp; said crawl&lt;br>
never think of Black bodies&lt;br>
hanging in trees or filled&lt;br>
with bullet holes&lt;br>
never hear my sisters say&lt;br>
white folks hair stinks&lt;br>
don’t trust any of them&lt;br>
never feel my father&lt;br>
turn in his grave&lt;br>
never hear my mother talk&lt;br>
of her backache after scrubbing floors&lt;br>
never hear her cry&lt;br>
Lord, what kind of child is this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>III.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>my lover&amp;rsquo;s eyes are blue&lt;br>
&amp;amp; when she looks at me&lt;br>
i float in a warm lake&lt;br>
     feel my muscles go weak with want&lt;br>
          feel good&lt;br>
          feel safe&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then—i never think of the blue&lt;br>
eyes that have glared at me&lt;br>
moved three stools away from me&lt;br>
in a bar&lt;br>
never hear my sisters rage&lt;br>
of syphilitic Black men as&lt;br>
guinea pigs&lt;br>
     rage of sterilized children&lt;br>
          watch them just stop in an&lt;br>
          intersection to scare the old&lt;br>
          white bitch&lt;br>
never feel my father turn&lt;br>
in his grave&lt;br>
never remember my mother&lt;br>
teaching me the yes sirs &amp;amp; ma&amp;rsquo;ams&lt;br>
to keep me alive&lt;br>
never hear my mother cry&lt;br>
Lord, what kind of child is this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>IV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;amp; when we go to a gay bar&lt;br>
&amp;amp; my people shun me because i crossed&lt;br>
the line&lt;br>
&amp;amp; her people look to see what&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br>
wrong with her&lt;br>
     what defect&lt;br>
     drove her to me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;amp; when we walk the streets&lt;br>
of this city&lt;br>
     forget and touch&lt;br>
     or hold hands&lt;br>
          &amp;amp; the people&lt;br>
          stare, glare, frown, &amp;amp; taunt&lt;br>
               at those queers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i remember&lt;br>
     every word taught me&lt;br>
     every word said to me&lt;br>
     every deed done to me&lt;br>
          &amp;amp; then i hate&lt;br>
i look at my lover&lt;br>
&amp;amp; for an instant&lt;br>
     doubt&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then—i hold her hand tighter&lt;br>
     &amp;amp; i can hear my mother cry.&lt;br>

I’m full of ugly feelings, awful thoughts, bad dreams&lt;br>

Someone answers, No, it’s something else&lt;br>

A good person gives and asks for nothing in return.&lt;br>
I give and I ask for only one thing—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hear me. Hear me. Hear me. Hear me. Hear me.&lt;br>
Hear me. Bear the weight of my voice and don’t forget—&lt;br>
things haunt. Things exist long after they are killed.&lt;/p>
