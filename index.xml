&lt;p>no one leaves home unless&lt;br>
home is the mouth of a shark&lt;br>
you only run for the border&lt;br>
when you see the whole city running as well&lt;/p>
&lt;p>your neighbors running faster than you&lt;br>
breath bloody in their throats&lt;br>
the boy you went to school with&lt;br>
who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory&lt;br>
is holding a gun bigger than his body&lt;br>
you only leave home&lt;br>
when home won’t let you stay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>no one leaves home unless home chases you&lt;br>
fire under feet&lt;br>
hot blood in your belly&lt;br>
it’s not something you ever thought of doing&lt;br>
until the blade burnt threats into&lt;br>
your neck&lt;br>
and even then you carried the anthem under&lt;br>
your breath&lt;br>
only tearing up your passport in an airport toilet&lt;br>
sobbing as each mouthful of paper&lt;br>
made it clear that you wouldn’t be going back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>you have to understand,&lt;br>
that no one puts their children in a boat&lt;br>
unless the water is safer than the land&lt;br>
no one burns their palms&lt;br>
under trains&lt;br>
beneath carriages&lt;br>
no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck&lt;br>
feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled&lt;br>
means something more than journey.&lt;br>
no one crawls under fences&lt;br>
no one wants to be beaten&lt;br>
pitied&lt;/p>
&lt;p>no one chooses refugee camps&lt;br>
or strip searches where your&lt;br>
body is left aching&lt;br>
or prison,&lt;br>
because prison is safer&lt;br>
than a city of fire&lt;br>
and one prison guard&lt;br>
in the night&lt;br>
is better than a truckload&lt;br>
of men who look like your father&lt;br>
no one could take it&lt;br>
no one could stomach it&lt;br>
no one skin would be tough enough&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the&lt;br>
go home blacks&lt;br>
refugees&lt;br>
dirty immigrants&lt;br>
asylum seekers&lt;br>
sucking our country dry&lt;br>
niggers with their hands out&lt;br>
they smell strange&lt;br>
savage&lt;br>
messed up their country and now they want&lt;br>
to mess ours up&lt;br>
how do the words&lt;br>
the dirty looks&lt;br>
roll off your backs&lt;br>
maybe because the blow is softer&lt;br>
than a limb torn off&lt;/p>
&lt;p>or the words are more tender&lt;br>
than fourteen men between&lt;br>
your legs&lt;br>
or the insults are easier&lt;br>
to swallow&lt;br>
than rubble&lt;br>
than bone&lt;br>
than your child body&lt;br>
in pieces.&lt;br>
i want to go home,&lt;br>
but home is the mouth of a shark&lt;br>
home is the barrel of the gun&lt;br>
and no one would leave home&lt;br>
unless home chased you to the shore&lt;br>
unless home told you&lt;br>
to quicken your legs&lt;br>
leave your clothes behind&lt;br>
crawl through the desert&lt;br>
wade through the oceans&lt;br>
drown&lt;br>
save&lt;br>
be hunger&lt;br>
beg&lt;br>
forget pride&lt;br>
your survival is more important&lt;/p>
&lt;p>no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear&lt;br>
saying-&lt;br>
leave,&lt;br>
run away from me now&lt;br>
i dont know what i’ve become&lt;br>
but i know that anywhere&lt;br>
is safer than here&lt;/p>

O songs of the River of Blood,”&lt;br>
       Let me lie down. Let my words&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lie sound in the mouths of men&lt;br>
Repeating invocations pure&lt;br>
       And perfect as a moan&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That mounts in the mouth of Bessie Smith.&lt;br>
Blues for the angels kicked out&lt;br>
       Of heaven. Blues for the angels&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who miss them still. Blues&lt;br>
For my people and what water&lt;br>
       They know. O weary drinkers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drinking from the bloody river,&lt;br>
Why go to heaven with Harlem&lt;br>
       So close? Why sing of rivers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With fathers of our own to miss?&lt;br>
I remember mine and taste a stain&lt;br>
       Like blood coursing the body&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of a man chased by a mob. I write&lt;br>
His running, his sweat: here,&lt;br>
       He climbs a poplar for the sky,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it is only sky. The river?&lt;br>
Follow me. You’ll see. We tried&lt;br>
       To fly and learned we couldn’t&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Swim. Dear singing river full&lt;br>
Of my blood, are we as loud under&lt;br>
       Water? Is it blood that binds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brothers? Or is it the Mississippi&lt;br>
Running through the fattest vein&lt;br>
       Of America? When I say home,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean I wanted to write some&lt;br>
Lines. I wanted to hear the blues,&lt;br>
       But here I am swimming in the river&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again. What flows through the fat&lt;br>
Veins of a drowned body? What&lt;br>
       America can a body call&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Home? When I say Congo, I mean&lt;br>
Blood. When I say Nile, I mean blood.&lt;br>
       When I say Euphrates, I mean,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If only you knew what blood&lt;br>
We have in common. So much,&lt;br>
       In Louisiana, they call a man like me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Red. And red was too dark&lt;br>
For my daddy. And my daddy was&lt;br>
       Too dark for America. He ran&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like a man from my mother&lt;br>
And me. And my mother’s sobs&lt;br>
       Are the songs of Bessie Smith&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who wears more feathers than&lt;br>
Death. O the death my people refuse&lt;br>
       To die. When I was 18, I wrote down&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The river though I couldn’t win&lt;br>
A race, climbed a tree that winter, then&lt;br>
       Fell, flat on my wet, red face. Line&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After line, I read all the time,&lt;br>
But “there was nothing I could do&lt;br>
       About race.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>my lover is a woman&lt;br>
&amp;amp; when i hold her&lt;br>
feel her warmth&lt;br>
     i feel good&lt;br>
     feel safe&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then—i never think of&lt;br>
my family’s voices&lt;br>
never hear my sisters say&lt;br>
bulldaggers, queers, funny&lt;br>
     come see us, but don’t&lt;br>
     bring your friends&lt;br>
          it’s ok with us,&lt;br>
          but don’t tell mama&lt;br>
          it’d break her heart&lt;br>
never feel my father&lt;br>
turn in his grave&lt;br>
never hear my mother cry&lt;br>
Lord, what kind of child is this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>II.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>my lover’s hair is blonde&lt;br>
&amp;amp; when it rubs across my face&lt;br>
it feels soft&lt;br>
     feels like a thousand fingers&lt;br>
     touch my skin &amp;amp; hold me&lt;br>
          and i feel good&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then—i never think of the little boy&lt;br>
who spat &amp;amp; called me nigger&lt;br>
never think of the policemen&lt;br>
who kicked my body &amp;amp; said crawl&lt;br>
never think of Black bodies&lt;br>
hanging in trees or filled&lt;br>
with bullet holes&lt;br>
never hear my sisters say&lt;br>
white folks hair stinks&lt;br>
don’t trust any of them&lt;br>
never feel my father&lt;br>
turn in his grave&lt;br>
never hear my mother talk&lt;br>
of her backache after scrubbing floors&lt;br>
never hear her cry&lt;br>
Lord, what kind of child is this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>III.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>my lover&amp;rsquo;s eyes are blue&lt;br>
&amp;amp; when she looks at me&lt;br>
i float in a warm lake&lt;br>
     feel my muscles go weak with want&lt;br>
          feel good&lt;br>
          feel safe&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then—i never think of the blue&lt;br>
eyes that have glared at me&lt;br>
moved three stools away from me&lt;br>
in a bar&lt;br>
never hear my sisters rage&lt;br>
of syphilitic Black men as&lt;br>
guinea pigs&lt;br>
     rage of sterilized children&lt;br>
          watch them just stop in an&lt;br>
          intersection to scare the old&lt;br>
          white bitch&lt;br>
never feel my father turn&lt;br>
in his grave&lt;br>
never remember my mother&lt;br>
teaching me the yes sirs &amp;amp; ma&amp;rsquo;ams&lt;br>
to keep me alive&lt;br>
never hear my mother cry&lt;br>
Lord, what kind of child is this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>IV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;amp; when we go to a gay bar&lt;br>
&amp;amp; my people shun me because i crossed&lt;br>
the line&lt;br>
&amp;amp; her people look to see what&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br>
wrong with her&lt;br>
     what defect&lt;br>
     drove her to me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;amp; when we walk the streets&lt;br>
of this city&lt;br>
     forget and touch&lt;br>
     or hold hands&lt;br>
          &amp;amp; the people&lt;br>
          stare, glare, frown, &amp;amp; taunt&lt;br>
               at those queers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i remember&lt;br>
     every word taught me&lt;br>
     every word said to me&lt;br>
     every deed done to me&lt;br>
          &amp;amp; then i hate&lt;br>
i look at my lover&lt;br>
&amp;amp; for an instant&lt;br>
     doubt&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then—i hold her hand tighter&lt;br>
     &amp;amp; i can hear my mother cry.&lt;br>

I’m full of ugly feelings, awful thoughts, bad dreams&lt;br>

Someone answers, No, it’s something else&lt;br>

A good person gives and asks for nothing in return.&lt;br>
I give and I ask for only one thing—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hear me. Hear me. Hear me. Hear me. Hear me.&lt;br>
Hear me. Bear the weight of my voice and don’t forget—&lt;br>
things haunt. Things exist long after they are killed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Name it &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.github.io&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Make it a public repository. Do not add a README or Gitignore or whatever: an empty repository is fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mine is &lt;a href="https://github.com/matchalunatic/matchalunatic.github.io">https://github.com/matchalunatic/matchalunatic.github.io&lt;/a>, check it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="create-a-local-repository-and-set-your-github-repository-as-remote">create a local repository and set your GitHub repository as remote&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the terminal, that&amp;rsquo;s a matter of running&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git init &amp;lt;YourRepositoryName&amp;gt;
cd &amp;lt;YourRepositoryName&amp;gt;
git remote add origin git@github.com:&amp;lt;YourUsername&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;YourRepositoryName&amp;gt;.git
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you can add this repository to your IDE if you use one (I will use VS Code here).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are not into CLI it&amp;rsquo;s okay too. With VS Code, there are a few more steps
but overall it&amp;rsquo;s simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>open the command palette (Ctrl+shift+P on Windows and Linux, Command+shift+P on a Mac)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>search for the Clone repository action (type &amp;ldquo;Clone&amp;rdquo; and it will find it) and run it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>when asked for it, paste the &lt;code>git@github.com:...&lt;/code> URL provided&lt;/li>
&lt;li>select &amp;ldquo;Clone from GitHub&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>allow the GitHub extension to access your GitHub account, it&amp;rsquo;s safe&lt;/li>
&lt;li>then pick the location where you want your GitHub repository to be cloned&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and add it to your workspace!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="bootstrapping-hugo">Bootstrapping Hugo&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This uses the terminal, so please open your favorite terminal and switch to the newly created repository folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tip: if you use VS Code, you just have to right-click the folder and click &amp;ldquo;Open in integrated terminal&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then run the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hugo new site . --force
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will create a Hugo site in your Git repository. We are almost there, as we need to pick a theme. I propose we use the Diary theme&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is done with the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git submodule add https://github.com/AmazingRise/hugo-theme-diary.git themes/diary
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This clones the Diary theme of Hugo to the &lt;code>themes/diary&lt;/code> folder in your local project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we just need to edit the config.toml file to tell Hugo we want to use that theme: just add a
line containing the following to that file:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml">&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">theme&lt;/span> = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;diary&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>While we are at it we will also edit the infos about our blog. In the end the toml file will resemble that:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml">&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">baseURL&lt;/span> = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;https://&amp;lt;YourGitHubUsername&amp;gt;.github.io/&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">languageCode&lt;/span> = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;en-uk&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">title&lt;/span> = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;MatchaLunatic&amp;#39;s women and queer folks poetry blog&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">theme&lt;/span> = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;diary&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It will be very generic for the moment but we can already see it working by running&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hugo server -D
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and clicking the provided link. This is only a local server but you now got something ready to create content. Let&amp;rsquo;s publish the source for that already&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="publishing-the-source-code-a-first-step">Publishing the source code: a first step&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We will commit the code. This is basically publishing the changeset we made to it online, in a distinct object with an author (you), a date, a message, and contents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the terminal, this is done like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git add .
git commit -m &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;My first commit in this blog&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Using VS Code, you need to enter the &amp;ldquo;Source Control&amp;rdquo; panel in the toolbar.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="scicon.png"
alt="a branch icon, with three dots and connecting lines forming a Y"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>such an icon&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>then right click on &amp;ldquo;Changes&amp;rdquo;, select &amp;ldquo;Stage all Changes&amp;rdquo;, then enter a Message on top of the &amp;ldquo;Staged changes&amp;rdquo; section and validate with Ctrl+Enter&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we have created a change and committed it to the repository. We can send it to GitHub and the source code will then be published.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the terminal, it&amp;rsquo;s done this way:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git push -u origin main
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Using VS Code, you can click on the &amp;lsquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; icon next to the repository name and click on &amp;ldquo;Push&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you refresh the page on GitHub, you will now see your source code! And so can everyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="publishing-the-website-now">Publishing the website now&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We now enter the world of DevOps. Without DevOps tools, in order to publish a Hugo website to GitHub pages you would need to do the following actions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>run the &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> command to generate the &lt;code>public&lt;/code> folder on your laptop&lt;/li>
&lt;li>create a Git branch &lt;code>gh-pages&lt;/code> in your repository (using &lt;code>git checkout -b gh-pages&lt;/code> for example)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>empty that branch and add only the &lt;code>public&lt;/code> folder to it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>push that branch to the remote &lt;code>gh-pages&lt;/code> branch on GitHub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(first-time only) enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings on GitHub&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We will make use of an automation tool, called a GitHub Action, that will do just that automatically each time we push our changes to the main branch of our repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The action is available from &lt;a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo">https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo&lt;/a>, and you can copy mine from here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/matchalunatic/matchalunatic.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml">https://github.com/matchalunatic/matchalunatic.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml&lt;/a> (click the &amp;ldquo;Copy Raw contents&amp;rdquo; button which is 2 stacked squares). You can just copy it as-is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Commit and push your changes like before, and the GitHub action will trigger. You can check it out directly from GitHub by clicking the Actions button on the menu bar of your repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is our first time publishing the website, we need to run an extra step just this once:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go to your repository&amp;rsquo;s Settings tab on GitHub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click the Pages tab on the left menu&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pick the Source for GitHub Pages as branch gh-pages and click Save.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That&amp;rsquo;s it! Your website will appear online after a few seconds on https://&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.github.io&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="lets-add-contents">Let&amp;rsquo;s add Contents!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>First let&amp;rsquo;s create an about-me page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open the terminal and run the following command&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hugo new about-me/index.md
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Content &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;/home/matcha/personal/blog/b2021/content/about-me/index.md&amp;#34;&lt;/span> created
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Open the file whose path is given by the command and edit it a little so it looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">---

# About me
Hey, my name is Matcha and I am participating in a workshop!
Happy to be here!
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can then check how it looks like locally by running&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hugo server -D
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and opening the link given by the command in your browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you&amp;rsquo;re happy with the result, commit, push and see the results online: that&amp;rsquo;s DevOps magic.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="add-more-contents">Add more contents&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Pick one file from &lt;a href="https://github.com/matchalunatic/queer-and-womens-poems">https://github.com/matchalunatic/queer-and-womens-poems&lt;/a>. Download the file and add it to your repository under a &lt;code>contents/posts&lt;/code> folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check the result locally. Then commit, push, see it online. More DevOps magic.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="cooperating">Cooperating&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>DevOps is a lot about working together. Turn to your neighbour, ask them the URL for their Git repository, and you can work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We won&amp;rsquo;t have time for this right now but you can then clone their website locally, make changes (like adding a new poem or something else), and then open a Pull Request to their repository. This is a nice way to cooperate although there are others (like git branches).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>DevOps is about doing the heavy lifting as automatically as possible. For this workshop, I did not write a single line of code, I focused on what I wanted to do best: contents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the ground work was done we were able to just focus on contents and that&amp;rsquo;s one of the great things with DevOps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to dive deeper, feel free to hang out and we can discuss stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;3
